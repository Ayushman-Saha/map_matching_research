There are hardly any publicly available data sets regarding real-world
GPS movements of vehicles despite their potential applications such as
map matching, map inferences, traffic detection, 
to name a few.
Even amongst the handful of data sets that are available, the quality
of the dataset varies significantly, not to mention the different
geographical area these datasets covers.
We acknowledge the obstacles in collecting such that with
privacy being the major concern. 
To bypass these obstacles, we construct a 
framework to generate synthetic data 
regarding GPS coordinates of vehicular movements.
Using our framework, a researcher will be able to produce
the similar dataset for any region in the world as long 
as \texttt{openstreemaps} contains the corresponding GPS coordinates.
We believe this systematic way of generating datasets

We illustrate our approach by generating

\section{Introduction}
In recent years, GPS trajectory data has emerged as a valuable 
resource for various applications, 
including transportation optimization, 
urban planning, and mobility pattern analysis. 
The availability of large-scale, real-world GPS trajectory datasets enables 
researchers to develop and validate models for route prediction, 
traffic forecasting, and user behavior analysis.
However, such datasets are often sparse or difficult 
to obtain due to privacy concerns, data collection challenges, and/or regional limitations. 
Because of these limitations, there are only a handful of entities
that can collect such data.
While various organizations can theoretically collect GPS data, 
we believe only the ride-sharing services (like Grab, Uber)
and the digital map service providers (like Google Maps or Apple Maps) 
are uniquely positioned to gather such data
for the following reasons:

(1) \emph{Extensive and Diverse User Base:}
These companies operate on a massive scale, serving millions of active users across different regions. 
Unlike public transportation services or static maps, 
these platforms can collect data from a broad and diverse user base
spanning people from various backgrounds.
This diversity ensures that the data captured represents a wide spectrum of 
travel behaviors and preferences, making it more comprehensive. 
This would also avoid biases ensuring that the data is widely relevant and representative of real-world mobility patterns.

(2) \emph{Comprehensive Geographic Coverage:}
These platforms operate in multiple cities across various countries and 
can capture GPS data from users traveling along a wide range of routes.
This geographic breadth is especially valuable for understanding 
mobility.

(3) \emph{Time-Stamped Data Collection:}
As these platform can collect time-stamped GPS data,
they offers a dynamic picture of travel patterns.
For example, the time taken to cover the same route
can widely very depending whether the commute is during
the peak hours or wee hours.
Similarly, a route might take much longer to complete
in the likely presence of rain or fog.

(4) \emph{Detailed Movement Tracking:}
These platforms can capture fine-grained GPS data that tracks not just the start and end points of trips, but also intermediate stops, travel routes, and patterns of movement. 
For instance, ride-sharing companies can track how drivers navigate traffic, avoid congestion, and make route adjustments based on real-time conditions. %This detailed data is valuable for understanding more complex travel patterns, such as deviations from typical routes, detours, and adaptive driving strategies.

(5) \emph{Incentivized Data Collection:}
 Grab, Uber, and similar companies have built-in incentive structures that encourage users to contribute to data collection. 
For example, drivers and passengers benefit from improved service quality, optimized routes, and monetary rewards in exchange for sharing their location and journey data. 
A typical mobile user always keep sharing his/her location
as the functionality of most of the other necessary applications
replies on it.
This incentivize leads to a continuous flow of accurate and reliable data, helping these companies build large and diverse datasets.

It is hard to imagine any other entity apart from 
ride-hailing services and digital map service providers
that are able to collect search real-life data.
However, we could not find any data made available by these companies
(or any other entity) with a notable exception 
of the \textbf{Grab-Posisi} dataset, introduced by the group of researcher
at Grab~\cite{DBLP:conf/gis/XuYDHKFWZ20} in 2020.
The authors presented an comprehensive overview of the 
existing open source dataset and highlighted  their
drawbacks.
The paper also contains an excellent summary of 
the related work which to the best of our knowledge,
remains latest such.
The dataset includes trajectories from millions of users, covering a broad range of transportation modes, from private vehicles to shared rides and public transport.

Needless to say, very few scientist have access to the resources
that researcher at Grab have.
Considering their paper as a foundation, our work focuses on the generation of synthetic GPS trajectory data. 
While the real-world data \textbf{Grab-Posisi} offer rich insights, it is
constrained limited geographical coverage, and scalability. 
Synthetic data, which is artificially generated using statistical models, algorithms, or machine learning approaches, offers several key advantages. These include the ability to create large volumes of data without privacy concerns, simulate diverse and rare scenarios, and augment real-world data to improve the robustness of models trained on them.

Our primary contribution in this paper is the development of a novel methodology for generating synthetic GPS trajectories that resemble the movement patterns observed in India. 
We utilize a combination of tools from graph theory to 
simulate realistic trajectories. 
In doing so, we aim to complement real-world datasets with scalable, privacy-preserving data that can be used for a variety of applications, including transportation modeling, mobility prediction, and traffic management.
By advancing the field of synthetic trajectory data generation, we hope to contribute to the development of more scalable, accessible, and region-specific tools for urban mobility research.

\subsection{Overview}
The simulation framework is designed to process geospatial data and generate enriched datasets by simulating vehicle trajectories on a predefined graph.
The system leverages OpenStreetMap data and incorporates various environmental factors like rainfall, visibility, and traffic conditions. The code is modular, divided across three files.

\section{Dataset}

The simulation utilizes a synthetic dataset comprising 1.3 million records, representing diverse transportation scenarios. Each record captures a detailed route simulation, including spatial, temporal, and vehicular attributes. The dataset was generated to model real-world traffic patterns and route dynamics.

\subsection{Structure of the Dataset}

The dataset structure is summarized in Table~\ref{tab:dataset-structure}.

\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

\section{Methodology}

\subsection{Geospatial Data Source}
The graph used for the simulation represents the primary highways and trucking routes across India, extracted from OpenStreetMap (OSM). The graph is structured as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Nodes}: Represent junctions or intersections on the graph, stored as a GeoDataFrame with geospatial coordinates and attributes.
    \item \textbf{Edges}: Represent road segments between nodes, stored as a GeoDataFrame with geometry and other metadata.
\end{itemize}

Mathematically, the graph $G$ is defined as:

\[G = (V, E)\]

where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $V = \{v_1, v_2, ..., v_n\}$ is the set of vertices (nodes) representing road intersections, with each $v_i$ defined as:
    \[v_i = (lat_i, lon_i, A_i)\]
    where $lat_i, lon_i$ are geographical coordinates and $A_i$ is the set of attributes for node $i$.

    \item $E = \{e_1, e_2, ..., e_m\}$ is the set of edges representing road segments, with each $e_k$ defined as:
    \[e_k = (v_i, v_j, G_k, P_k)\]
    where $v_i, v_j \in V$ are connected nodes, $G_k$ is the geometry of the edge, and $P_k$ is the set of parameters associated with the edge.
\end{itemize}

\end{tabular}
}
\end{table}


\subsection{Path Generation}
Paths in the graph are generated using a three-step process: BFS-based layering, random walk algorithms, and categorization.

\subsubsection{BFS Layering}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Start a Breadth-First Search (BFS) from an initial node $v_0$.
    \item Organize nodes at distance $i$ into layer $L_n$, where $i \geq 1$. Each layer contains nodes reachable from the start node at a specific distance.
    \item Optionally, truncate the BFS after a fixed number of layers to limit the search space.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Random Walk Path Generation}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The random walk begins at $v_0$ (starting node).
    \item Select a vertex $v_1$ from $L_1$ (the first layer) that is adjacent to $v_0$.
    \item Proceed to a vertex $v_2$ in $L_2$, adjacent to $v_1$, and continue this process for successive layers.
    \item The walk terminates when no valid nodes remain in the next layer or when a predefined maximum path length is reached.
    \item Each path is unique, as vertices are not revisited within the same walk.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Categorization of Paths}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Compute the length of each path using the road segment lengths (edge metadata).
    \item Classify paths into categories based on predefined length ranges:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Small}: 10 to 20 kilometers
        \item \textbf{Medium}: 20 to 80 kilometers
        \item \textbf{Large}: 80 to 250 kilometers
        \item \textbf{XL}: 250 to 750 kilometers
    \end{itemize}
    \item Randomly sample a fixed number of paths from each category for further analysis.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Path Storage and Retrieval}
\subsubsection{Storage in database}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Paths are stored as documents in a NoSQL Database
    \item Each document contains:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Route}: A list of node IDs forming the path
        \item \textbf{Start Node}: The node from which the path begins
        \item \textbf{Route Length}: Total length of the path
        \item \textbf{Category}: The length-based category of the path
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Reconstruction}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Paths are retrieved from database as routes and applied to the graph stored in GraphML format.
    \item Fetched paths are converted into GeoDataFrames using the node and edge geospatial data for further processing.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Types of Parameters}
Parameters influencing the simulation are categorized into two types:

\subsubsection{Grouped Parameters}
Grouped parameters require pre-existing grouped data in nodes or edges. These parameters are processed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Grouping}: Data is grouped based on a predefined logic (e.g., seasonal rainfall averages).
    \item \textbf{Statistics}: The mean and standard deviation for each group are calculated.
    \item \textbf{Normalization}: The grouped data is normalized using the sigmoid function to standardize its values.
\end{enumerate}

This approach is commonly used for parameters like seasonal rainfall and visibility, which are aggregated and averaged over specific time periods or regions.

\subsubsection{Ungrouped Parameters}
Ungrouped parameters are directly normalized without requiring any prior grouping. These parameters exist as single values per node or edge (e.g., \texttt{betweenness\_centrality}). The process involves:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Direct Normalization}: The parameter values are normalized using their mean and standard deviation across the dataset.
    \item \textbf{Usage}: These normalized values are then directly applied in the simulation.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Point Generation Algorithm}
The point generation process is a key component of this simulation framework. It focuses on generating high-resolution geospatial points along edges of the graph while incorporating dynamic environmental and traffic parameters. A \textbf{segment} is defined as a particular edge divided into a specific interval in meters.

\subsubsection{Defining Y}
Initially, Y is set based on the vehicle type and a predefined sampling rate. For instance, vehicles such as cars or trucks have different base rates for generating points along an edge segment. This base Y value (denoted as $Y_0$) reflects the sampling density and is adjusted dynamically based on parameter changes during the simulation.

\subsubsection{Adjusting Y Dynamically}
The adjustment of Y is influenced by changes in grouped and global parameters:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Grouped Parameters}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each point along an edge is assigned interpolated values for grouped parameters (e.g., rainfall, visibility) based on their location relative to the edge's start and end nodes.
        \item For each parameter, the difference ($\Delta$) between the current and previous values is calculated.
        \item A coefficient specific to the parameter (sampled from a defined range) is applied to $\Delta$ to compute a multiplicative factor.
        \item This factor modifies the base $Y_0$, increasing or decreasing the sampling density in response to environmental variability.
    \end{itemize}

    \item \textbf{Global Parameters}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Global parameters, such as traffic density, are similarly incorporated by comparing their current and previous values.
        \item A traffic-specific coefficient (derived from edge attributes, such as betweenness centrality) is applied to adjust Y.
        \item The result reflects traffic dynamics, increasing sampling density during high traffic periods.
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Mathematical Formula for Adjusting Y}
The adjusted Y, denoted as $Y_{adjusted}$, is computed iteratively for each point along a segment using the formula:

\[
Y_{adjusted} = Y_0 \times \prod_{i} \big( 1 + C_i \times |\Delta_i| \big)
\]

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $Y_0$: Base sampling rate for the vehicle type
    \item $C_i$: Coefficient for parameter $i$
    \item $\Delta_i$: Change in the parameter $i$ from the previous point
    \item The product iterates over all grouped and global parameters influencing the point
\end{itemize}

\section{Pre-GPS Generation Path Analysis}

\subsubsection{Statistical Analysis of Path Variations}
The analysis revealed significant variability between the path types, particularly in the Large and XL categories, where higher standard deviations were observed.

\begin{table}[h!]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Category} & \textbf{Mean (km)} & \textbf{Median (km)} & \textbf{Std Dev (km)} \\
\hline
Small & 14.693 & 14.520 & 2.943 \\
Medium & 47.369 & 46.350 & 18.500 \\
Large & 141.521 & 130.828 & 46.679 \\
XL & 309.356 & 289.982 & 61.787 \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Statistical Measures of Path Variations}
\label{tab:path_stats}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Distribution of Path Variations}
The distribution analysis of paths across categories revealed distinct patterns in route selection:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Small paths: 24.5\% of total routes
    \item Medium paths: 31.7\%
    \item Large paths: 27.7\%
    \item XL paths: 16.1\%
\end{itemize}

    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/path_dist.png}
    \caption{Distribution of path variations across categories}
    \label{fig:path_dist}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Turn Index Analysis}

\subsubsection{Significant Turns Analysis}
The Turn Severity Index (TSI) is defined as a weighted measure of significant turns along a road segment, normalized by the path length. For a given path $P$, the TSI is calculated as:

\begin{equation}
    \text{TSI}(P) = \frac{\sum_{i} w_i \times n_i}{L}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $w_i$ represents the weight assigned to turn angle $\theta_i$
    \item $n_i$ is the number of turns with angle $\theta_i$
    \item $L$ is the total path length in kilometers
    \item $i \in \{15°, 30°, 60°, 180°\}$
\end{itemize}

The weight assignments are defined as:
\begin{equation}
    w(\theta) = \begin{cases}
        1.0 & \text{for } \theta = 15° \\
        1.5 & \text{for } \theta = 30° \\
        2.0 & \text{for } \theta = 60° \\
        3.0 & \text{for } \theta = 180°
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Visibility Analysis}

\subsubsection{Data Overview}
The visibility analysis encompassed comprehensive atmospheric condition assessment across road segments, quantifying potential visibility-related risks during travel.

\subsubsection{Seasonal Visibility Distribution}
The visibility conditions were analyzed across different seasons to identify temporal patterns and regional variations.

\section{Post-GPS Generation Dataset Analysis}

\subsection{Dataset Characteristics}
The dataset encompasses three randomly chosen attributes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vehicle Type Distribution:} Cars, trucks, and motorcycles
    \item \textbf{Seasonal Distribution:} Summer, winter, spring, and autumn
    \item \textbf{Time Distribution:} 24-hour period sampling
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Vehicle Type Distribution}
Different vehicle types exhibit distinct driving behaviors, with motorcycles showing higher speeds and more deviations compared to trucks and cars.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/vehicle_dist.png}
    \caption{Distribution of vehicle types in synthetic road data}
    \label{fig:vehicle_dist}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Seasonal Distribution}
Seasonal variations significantly influence road and traffic conditions.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/season_dist.png}
    \caption{Seasonal distribution in synthetic road data}
    \label{fig:season_dist}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Distribution of Average Error Distance}
The distribution of average error distance shows distinct peaks, indicating multiple driving patterns.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Distribution of Average Speed}
The average speed distribution exhibits multimodal characteristics.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{images/speed_dist.png}
    \caption{Distribution of average speed in synthetic road data}
    \label{fig:speed_dist}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Impact of Vehicle Type and Season}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vehicle Type Influence:} Vehicle categories show distinct patterns in error distances and speeds
    \item \textbf{Seasonal Impact:} Weather conditions affect driving patterns and error distributions
\end{itemize}




\section{Misc}

Our dataset can be partitioned into two parts:
In the first part, we provide a representation of roads in India
using GPS co-ordinates and line-segments joining the 
these co-ordinates.
We extra the raw information from \texttt{openstreemaps}
and process the data to make it accessible.
In the second part, we present a dataset 
in which each data point consists of series 
of raw GPS co-ordinates.
This data point can be interpreted as a vehicular moment. 
The first part of our dataset consists of XYZ many GPS coordinates,
XYZ many line segments which together constitutes road networks
of XYZ kilometers.
The second part contains XYZ many sequences corresponding
to vehicular movements.
These sequences are of varying complexities and charcters
and together they span total of XYZ kilometers.

\section{Default Sections in Original Documents}

ACM's consolidated article template, introduced in 2017, provides a
consistent \LaTeX\ style for use across ACM publications, and
incorporates accessibility and metadata-extraction functionality
necessary for future Digital Library endeavors. Numerous ACM and
SIG-specific \LaTeX\ templates have been examined, and their unique
features incorporated into this single new template.

If you are new to publishing with ACM, this document is a valuable
guide to the process of preparing your work for publication. If you
have published with ACM before, this document provides insight and
instruction into more recent changes to the article template.

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class can be used to prepare articles
for any ACM publication --- conference or journal, and for any stage
of publication, from review to final ``camera-ready'' copy, to the
author's own version, with {\itshape very} few changes to the source.

\section{Template Overview}
As noted in the introduction, the ``\verb|acmart|'' document class can
be used to prepare many different kinds of documentation --- a
double-anonymous initial submission of a full-length technical paper, a
two-page SIGGRAPH Emerging Technologies abstract, a ``camera-ready''
journal article, a SIGCHI Extended Abstract, and more --- all by
selecting the appropriate {\itshape template style} and {\itshape
  template parameters}.

This document will explain the major features of the document
class. For further information, the {\itshape \LaTeX\ User's Guide} is
available from
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}.

\subsection{Template Styles}

The primary parameter given to the ``\verb|acmart|'' document class is
the {\itshape template style} which corresponds to the kind of publication
or SIG publishing the work. This parameter is enclosed in square
brackets and is a part of the {\verb|documentclass|} command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \documentclass[STYLE]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

Journals use one of three template styles. All but three ACM journals
use the {\verb|acmsmall|} template style:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\texttt{acmsmall}}: The default journal template style.
\item {\texttt{acmlarge}}: Used by JOCCH and TAP.
\item {\texttt{acmtog}}: Used by TOG.
\end{itemize}

The majority of conference proceedings documentation will use the {\verb|acmconf|} template style.
\begin{itemize}
\item {\texttt{sigconf}}: The default proceedings template style.
\item{\texttt{sigchi}}: Used for SIGCHI conference articles.
\item{\texttt{sigplan}}: Used for SIGPLAN conference articles.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Template Parameters}

In addition to specifying the {\itshape template style} to be used in
formatting your work, there are a number of {\itshape template parameters}
which modify some part of the applied template style. A complete list
of these parameters can be found in the {\itshape \LaTeX\ User's Guide.}

Frequently-used parameters, or combinations of parameters, include:
\begin{itemize}
\item {\texttt{anonymous,review}}: Suitable for a ``double-anonymous''
  conference submission. Anonymizes the work and includes line
  numbers. Use with the \texttt{\string\acmSubmissionID} command to print the
  submission's unique ID on each page of the work.
\item{\texttt{authorversion}}: Produces a version of the work suitable
  for posting by the author.
\item{\texttt{screen}}: Produces colored hyperlinks.
\end{itemize}

This document uses the following string as the first command in the
source file:
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[sigplan,screen]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Modifications}

Modifying the template --- including but not limited to: adjusting
margins, typeface sizes, line spacing, paragraph and list definitions,
and the use of the \verb|\vspace| command to manually adjust the
vertical spacing between elements of your work --- is not allowed.

{\bfseries Your document will be returned to you for revision if
  modifications are discovered.}

\section{Typefaces}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class requires the use of the
``Libertine'' typeface family. Your \TeX\ installation should include
this set of packages. Please do not substitute other typefaces. The
``\verb|lmodern|'' and ``\verb|ltimes|'' packages should not be used,
as they will override the built-in typeface families.

\section{Title Information}

The title of your work should use capital letters appropriately -
\url{https://capitalizemytitle.com/} has useful rules for
capitalization. Use the {\verb|title|} command to define the title of
your work. If your work has a subtitle, define it with the
{\verb|subtitle|} command.  Do not insert line breaks in your title.

If your title is lengthy, you must define a short version to be used
in the page headers, to prevent overlapping text. The \verb|title|
command has a ``short title'' parameter:
\begin{verbatim}
  \title[short title]{full title}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Authors and Affiliations}

Each author must be defined separately for accurate metadata
identification.  As an exception, multiple authors may share one
affiliation. Authors' names should not be abbreviated; use full first
names wherever possible. Include authors' e-mail addresses whenever
possible.

Grouping authors' names or e-mail addresses, or providing an ``e-mail
alias,'' as shown below, is not acceptable:
\begin{verbatim}
  \author{Brooke Aster, David Mehldau}
  \email{dave,judy,steve@university.edu}
  \email{firstname.lastname@phillips.org}
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|authornote| and \verb|authornotemark| commands allow a note
to apply to multiple authors --- for example, if the first two authors
of an article contributed equally to the work.

If your author list is lengthy, you must define a shortened version of
the list of authors to be used in the page headers, to prevent
overlapping text. The following command should be placed just after
the last \verb|\author{}| definition:
\begin{verbatim}
  \renewcommand{\shortauthors}{McCartney, et al.}
\end{verbatim}
Omitting this command will force the use of a concatenated list of all
of the authors' names, which may result in overlapping text in the
page headers.

The article template's documentation, available at
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template}, has a
complete explanation of these commands and tips for their effective
use.

Note that authors' addresses are mandatory for journal articles.

\section{Rights Information}

Authors of any work published by ACM will need to complete a rights
form. Depending on the kind of work, and the rights management choice
made by the author, this may be copyright transfer, permission,
license, or an OA (open access) agreement.

Regardless of the rights management choice, the author will receive a
copy of the completed rights form once it has been submitted. This
form contains \LaTeX\ commands that must be copied into the source
document. When the document source is compiled, these commands and
their parameters add formatted text to several areas of the final
document:
\begin{itemize}
\item the ``ACM Reference Format'' text on the first page.
\item the ``rights management'' text on the first page.
\item the conference information in the page header(s).
\end{itemize}

Rights information is unique to the work; if you are preparing several
works for an event, make sure to use the correct set of commands with
each of the works.

The ACM Reference Format text is required for all articles over one
page in length, and is optional for one-page articles (abstracts).

\section{CCS Concepts and User-Defined Keywords}

Two elements of the ``acmart'' document class provide powerful
taxonomic tools for you to help readers find your work in an online
search.

The ACM Computing Classification System ---
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/class-2012} --- is a set of
classifiers and concepts that describe the computing
discipline. Authors can select entries from this classification
system, via \url{https://dl.acm.org/ccs/ccs.cfm}, and generate the
commands to be included in the \LaTeX\ source.

User-defined keywords are a comma-separated list of words and phrases
of the authors' choosing, providing a more flexible way of describing
the research being presented.

CCS concepts and user-defined keywords are required for for all
articles over two pages in length, and are optional for one- and
two-page articles (or abstracts).

\section{Sectioning Commands}

Your work should use standard \LaTeX\ sectioning commands:
\verb|\section|, \verb|\subsection|, \verb|\subsubsection|,
\verb|\paragraph|, and \verb|\subparagraph|. The sectioning levels up to
\verb|\subsusection| should be numbered; do not remove the numbering
from the commands.

Simulating a sectioning command by setting the first word or words of
a paragraph in boldface or italicized text is {\bfseries not allowed.}

Below are examples of sectioning commands.

\subsection{Subsection}
\label{sec:subsection}

This is a subsection.

\subsubsection{Subsubsection}
\label{sec:subsubsection}

This is a subsubsection.

\paragraph{Paragraph}

This is a paragraph.

\subparagraph{Subparagraph}

This is a subparagraph.

\section{Tables}

The ``\verb|acmart|'' document class includes the ``\verb|booktabs|''
package --- \url{https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs} --- for preparing
high-quality tables.

Table captions are placed {\itshape above} the table.

Because tables cannot be split across pages, the best placement for
them is typically the top of the page nearest their initial cite.  To
ensure this proper ``floating'' placement of tables, use the
environment \textbf{table} to enclose the table's contents and the
table caption.  The contents of the table itself must go in the
\textbf{tabular} environment, to be aligned properly in rows and
columns, with the desired horizontal and vertical rules.  Again,
detailed instructions on \textbf{tabular} material are found in the
\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}.

Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:freq} is included in the input file; compare the
placement of the table here with the table in the printed output of
this document.

\begin{table}
  \caption{Frequency of Special Characters}
  \label{tab:freq}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Non-English or Math&Frequency&Comments\\
    \midrule
    \O & 1 in 1,000& For Swedish names\\
    $\pi$ & 1 in 5& Common in math\\
    \$ & 4 in 5 & Used in business\\
    $\Psi^2_1$ & 1 in 40,000& Unexplained usage\\
  \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

To set a wider table, which takes up the whole width of the page's
live area, use the environment \textbf{table*} to enclose the table's
contents and the table caption.  As with a single-column table, this
wide table will ``float'' to a location deemed more
desirable. Immediately following this sentence is the point at which
Table~\ref{tab:commands} is included in the input file; again, it is
instructive to compare the placement of the table here with the table
in the printed output of this document.

\begin{table*}
  \caption{Some Typical Commands}
  \label{tab:commands}
  \begin{tabular}{ccl}
    \toprule
    Command &A Number & Comments\\
    \midrule
    \texttt{{\char'134}author} & 100& Author \\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table}& 300 & For tables\\
    \texttt{{\char'134}table*}& 400& For wider tables\\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{table*}

Always use midrule to separate table header rows from data rows, and
use it only for this purpose. This enables assistive technologies to
recognise table headers and support their users in navigating tables
more easily.

\section{Math Equations}
You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of the three are
discussed in the next sections.

\subsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}
A formula that appears in the running text is called an inline or
in-text formula.  It is produced by the \textbf{math} environment,
which can be invoked with the usual
\texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end} construction or with
the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You can use any of the symbols
and structures, from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a few
examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how this equation:
\begin{math}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{math},
set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsection{Display Equations}
A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols and
structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just give a couple
of examples of display equations in context.  First, consider the
equation, shown as an inline equation above:
\begin{equation}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{equation}
Notice how it is formatted somewhat differently in
the \textbf{displaymath}
environment.  Now, we'll enter an unnumbered equation:
\begin{displaymath}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x + 1
\end{displaymath}
and follow it with another numbered equation:
\begin{equation}
  \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}x_i=\int_{0}^{\pi+2} f
\end{equation}
just to demonstrate \LaTeX's able handling of numbering.

\section{Figures}

The ``\verb|figure|'' environment should be used for figures. One or
more images can be placed within a figure. If your figure contains
third-party material, you must clearly identify it as such, as shown
in the example below.
%\begin{figure}[h]
%  \centering
%  \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{sample-franklin}
%  \caption{1907 Franklin Model D roadster. Photograph by Harris \&
%    Ewing, Inc. [Public domain], via Wikimedia
%    Commons. (\url{https://goo.gl/VLCRBB}).}
%  \Description{A woman and a girl in white dresses sit in an open car.}
%\end{figure}

Your figures should contain a caption which describes the figure to
the reader.

Figure captions are placed {\itshape below} the figure.

Every figure should also have a figure description unless it is purely
decorative. These descriptions convey what’s in the image to someone
who cannot see it. They are also used by search engine crawlers for
indexing images, and when images cannot be loaded.

A figure description must be unformatted plain text less than 2000
characters long (including spaces).  {\bfseries Figure descriptions
  should not repeat the figure caption – their purpose is to capture
  important information that is not already provided in the caption or
  the main text of the paper.} For figures that convey important and
complex new information, a short text description may not be
adequate. More complex alternative descriptions can be placed in an
appendix and referenced in a short figure description. For example,
provide a data table capturing the information in a bar chart, or a
structured list representing a graph.  For additional information
regarding how best to write figure descriptions and why doing this is
so important, please see
\url{https://www.acm.org/publications/taps/describing-figures/}.

\subsection{The ``Teaser Figure''}

A ``teaser figure'' is an image, or set of images in one figure, that
are placed after all author and affiliation information, and before
the body of the article, spanning the page. If you wish to have such a
figure in your article, place the command immediately before the
\verb|\maketitle| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{teaserfigure}
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{sampleteaser}
    \caption{figure caption}
    \Description{figure description}
  \end{teaserfigure}
\end{verbatim}

\section{Citations and Bibliographies}

The use of \BibTeX\ for the preparation and formatting of one's
references is strongly recommended. Authors' names should be complete
--- use full first names (``Donald E. Knuth'') not initials
(``D. E. Knuth'') --- and the salient identifying features of a
reference should be included: title, year, volume, number, pages,
article DOI, etc.

The bibliography is included in your source document with these two
commands, placed just before the \verb|\end{document}| command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \bibliographystyle{ACM-Reference-Format}
  \bibliography{bibfile}
\end{verbatim}
where ``\verb|bibfile|'' is the name, without the ``\verb|.bib|''
suffix, of the \BibTeX\ file.

Citations and references are numbered by default. A small number of
ACM publications have citations and references formatted in the
``author year'' style; for these exceptions, please include this
command in the {\bfseries preamble} (before the command
``\verb|\begin{document}|'') of your \LaTeX\ source:
\begin{verbatim}
  \citestyle{acmauthoryear}
\end{verbatim}


  Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
  enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
  issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
  monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
  \cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
  \cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
  the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
  Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.),
  a chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a
  divisible book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as
  book \cite{Knuth97}, a couple of articles in a proceedings (of a
  conference, symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings
  article) \cite{Andler79, Hagerup1993}, a proceedings article with
  all possible elements \cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated
  proceedings article \cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work
  \cite{Harel78}, a couple of preprints \cite{Bornmann2019,
    AnzarootPBM14}, a doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a
  master's thesis: \cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web
  resource \cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game
  (Case 1) \cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05}
  and (Case 3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for
  publication \cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author
  \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and \cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might
  contain 'duplicate' DOI and URLs (some SIAM articles)
  \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}. Boris / Barbara Beeton:

\section{Acknowledgments}

Identification of funding sources and other support, and thanks to
individuals and groups that assisted in the research and the
preparation of the work should be included in an acknowledgment
section, which is placed just before the reference section in your
document.

This section has a special environment:
\begin{verbatim}
  \begin{acks}
  ...
  \end{acks}
\end{verbatim}
so that the information contained therein can be more easily collected
during the article metadata extraction phase, and to ensure
consistency in the spelling of the section heading.

Authors should not prepare this section as a numbered or unnumbered {\verb|\section|}; please use the ``{\verb|acks|}'' environment.

\section{Appendices}

If your work needs an appendix, add it before the
``\verb|\end{document}|'' command at the conclusion of your source
document.

Start the appendix with the ``\verb|appendix|'' command:
\begin{verbatim}
  \appendix
\end{verbatim}
and note that in the appendix, sections are lettered, not
numbered. This document has two appendices, demonstrating the section
and subsection identification method.

\section{Multi-language papers}

Papers may be written in languages other than English or include
titles, subtitles, keywords and abstracts in different languages (as a
rule, a paper in a language other than English should include an
English title and an English abstract).  Use \verb|language=...| for
every language used in the paper.  The last language indicated is the
main language of the paper.  For example, a French paper with
additional titles and abstracts in English and German may start with
the following command
\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass[sigconf, language=english, language=german,
               language=french]{acmart}
\end{verbatim}

The title, subtitle, keywords and abstract will be typeset in the main
language of the paper.  The commands \verb|\translatedXXX|, \verb|XXX|
begin title, subtitle and keywords, can be used to set these elements
in the other languages.  The environment \verb|translatedabstract| is
used to set the translation of the abstract.  These commands and
environment have a mandatory first argument: the language of the
second argument.  See \verb|sample-sigconf-i13n.tex| file for examples
of their usage.

\section{SIGCHI Extended Abstracts}

The ``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style (available only in \LaTeX\ and
not in Word) produces a landscape-orientation formatted article, with
a wide left margin. Three environments are available for use with the
``\verb|sigchi-a|'' template style, and produce formatted output in
the margin:
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{sidebar}:]  Place formatted text in the margin.
\item[\texttt{marginfigure}:] Place a figure in the margin.
\item[\texttt{margintable}:] Place a table in the margin.
\end{description}

%%
%% The acknowledgments section is defined using the "acks" environment
%% (and NOT an unnumbered section). This ensures the proper
%% identification of the section in the article metadata, and the
%% consistent spelling of the heading.
\begin{acks}
To Robert, for the bagels and explaining CMYK and color spaces.
\end{acks}

%%
%% The next two lines define the bibliography style to be used, and
%% the bibliography file.
