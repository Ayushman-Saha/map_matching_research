\begin{abstract}
There are hardly any publicly available data sets regarding real-world
GPS movements of vehicles despite their potential applications such as
map matching, map inferences, traffic detection, etc.
Even amongst the handful of data sets that are available, the quality
of the dataset varies significantly, not to mention the different
geographical area these datasets covers.
We acknowledge the obstacles in collecting such that with
privacy being the major concern. 
To bypass these obstacles, we construct a synthetic data 
regarding GPS coordinates of vehicular movements.
Our dataset can be partitioned into two parts:
In the first part, we provide a representation of roads in India
using GPS co-ordinates and line-segments joining the 
these co-ordinates.
We extra the raw information from \texttt{openstreemaps}
and process the data to make it accessible.
In the second part, we present a dataset 
in which each data point consists of series 
of raw GPS co-ordinates.
This data point can be interpreted as a vehicular moment. 
The first part of our dataset consists of XYZ many GPS coordinates,
XYZ many line segments which together constitutes road networks
of XYZ kilometers.
The second part contains XYZ many sequences corresponding
to vehicular movements.
These sequences are of varying complexities and charcters
and together they span total of XYZ kilometers. 

Our contribution consists not only of these datasets but also
a systematic way of generatic these datasets. 
Using our code, any researcher will be able to produce
the similar dataset for any region in the world as long 
as \texttt{openstreemaps} contains the corresponding GPS coordinates.
We believe this systematic way of generating datasets
fills the void of lack of datasets.
